# zero-bee üêù

A minimalistic web app for zero-based budgeting, written in Elm, featuring [remotestorage](https://remotestorage.io/) sync.

This is what I perceive as the core of zero-based budgeting: A list of transactions, and a budget that organizes these transactions for each month. 

## Roadmap
